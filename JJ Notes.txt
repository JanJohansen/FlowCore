1) Add a view (incl. route + nav updates) that implements a "node type list" and a code editor (use existing monacoeditor component) to edit vue single file component definition (.vue file).  
When a save button is clicked, the code is compiled locally using @vue/compiler-sfc @vue/compiler-dom and the result is shown next to the editor by using a dynamic component. 
Implement storing and loading w. localstorage for now.  
Prepare for pre-setting type info for the code editor.

2) When i open the function codeeditormodal.vue, I get the following error in the console. Can you fix it? 
node_modules/monaco-editor/min/vs/language/typescript/ts.worker.js:1 Failed to load module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.Understand this error
